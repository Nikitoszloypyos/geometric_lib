# Description
This program is used for calculation of area or perimeter of some math objects.

# How to use calculator:
1. Run `python calculate.py`
2. Enter the figure name. Available are Circle, Square, Triangle.
3. Enter the function: Area or Perimeter.
4. Enter figure sizes. Radius for circle, one side for square, and appropriate sides for triangle.
5. Get the answer!

# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: `S = πR²`
- Square: `S = a²`
- Triangle: `S = (p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c))**0.5` where p is semiperimeter
- Rectangle: `S = a * b`

## Perimeter
- Circle: `P = 2πR`
- Square: `P = 4a`
- Triangle: `P = a + b + c`
- Rectangle: `P = 2a + 2b`
